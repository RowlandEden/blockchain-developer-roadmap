## The Goal

Our goal is **not** to have the biggest list of everything available out there.
Our goal is to have a list of things that anybody would have to learn if they were to enter the field today.

## Contributing

Your contributions to this repo are always welcome!
Bear in mind, that this repo is *highly opinionated*, *unbiased* and *curated*.

**No PR will be discarded without explanation!**

## Guidelines

* **Adding everything available out there is not the goal!**  
The roadmaps represent the skillset most valuable in present time meaning that if you were to enter any of the listed fields today, that's what you would learn first. Although there is an endless amount of techniques, tools and components that were important in the past or appear promising to become relevant in the future, prioritize the skills that are generally most relevant for today's demand. Use your critical thinking to filter out non-essential stuff. Give honest arguments for why the resource should be included.
* **One item per Pull Request**  
There may be a discussion related to an item you want to add. Adding just a single item per pull request makes it much easier for everyone involved.
* Write meaningful commit messages
* Look at the existing issues/pull requests before opening new ones
